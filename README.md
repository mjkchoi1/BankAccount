The BankAccount program is designed to facilitate the creation and management of both checking and savings accounts. Users can interact with the program to perform various banking operations.

Upon running the program, the user is prompted to create a new account by providing their name and a unique ID. The BankAccount class is responsible for storing and managing the account information, including the customer's name, customer ID, and account balances.

The program presents a menu to the user, allowing them to choose between a savings account (option 'a') or a checking account (option 'b'). Based on the user's selection, they can perform specific operations related to the chosen account.

For a savings account, the user can:
- Check the account balance
- Deposit an amount into the account
- Withdraw an amount from the account
- View the details of the previous transaction
- Exit the savings account menu

For a checking account, the user can:
- Check the account balance
- Deposit an amount into the account
- Withdraw an amount from the account
- View the details of the previous transaction
- Exit the checking account menu

The program ensures that valid operations are performed. For example, if a user tries to withdraw more money than the available balance in the account, an appropriate error message is displayed.

After completing an operation or choosing to exit, the program thanks the user for using the banking services and terminates.

Overall, this program provides a basic framework for managing bank accounts, allowing users to perform common banking operations such as deposits, withdrawals, and checking balances for both savings and checking accounts.
